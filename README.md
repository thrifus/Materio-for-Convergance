# Materio Convergance LockHTML

The [Convergance](http://incendo.ws/projects/Convergance/) LockHTML version of [Materio](http://modmyi.com/info/materio.d.php). Slightly modified to fit the Convergance UI.

Changes are:
* Removed battery bar
* Moved clock to top and center
 
## Donations:
If you like my work, please consider donating. Since I'm a senior in high school and also working toward my Eagle Scout, I don't have time for a real job. Any donations would be greatly appreciated and would go towards buying better hardware, internet, etc.
